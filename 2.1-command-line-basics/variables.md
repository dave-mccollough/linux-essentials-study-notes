# Variables

Using variables to store values for easy reference.

A bash variable may contain a number, character or string of characters.  These variable types do not need to be declared, they are simply assigned

**Assigning a Variable**
`test_variable = "this is a variable"`

**Displaying a Variable**
`echo $test_variable`

**Default Variables**
- `$HOME` The current users working directory
- `PS1` The Primary prompt string
- `$PATH` A colon seperated list of directories where the shell looks for commands
