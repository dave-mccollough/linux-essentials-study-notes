# Info Pages

Additional documentatio with more robust capability and detail.

Info pages normally provide more detailed information about a command than it's respective Man Page.
Info pages use a structure for linking pages together that can be assembled into a larger collection

The info page is invoked by preceding the command with `info`
- `info COMMAND`
- `info ls`

If no info page exists, info can pull up documentation from the Man Page.
