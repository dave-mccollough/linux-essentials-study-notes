# Open-source Philosophy

## Philospophy
- The basic premise of open-source software is that source code is available for anyone to freely view, use, modify, or redistribute

## Forking
- When developers use the source code from one project to start and entirely new parallel project.

## Licensing
- **Permissive:**  No restrictions on licensing or derivative work
- **copyleft:**  Derivative work must use the same license as the original software
